# Check deloyment    

Check the state of nodes at the cloud machine:

```
kubectl get node

```{{execute}}  

There are two nodes, one assumes the master role and the other assumes the edge role, indicating that the edge side has been managed and controlled by the cloud side as a node.       

**Congratulations！KubeEdge has been deployed！**
